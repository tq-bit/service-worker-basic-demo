# Service worker basic feature demo (finished)

This repository is a boilerplate for my blog entry An introduction to Javascript Serviceworkers.

> Note that this is the branch with the finished code

You can set it up on your local mashine like this:

# Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tq-bit/service-worker-basic-demo.git
$ cd service-worker-basic-demo
```

You then have to use a VSCode plugin such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or another server setup to serve the html file with the service worker as it will not work over the file - protocol.
